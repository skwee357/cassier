# Cassier
Cassier knows everything about money and can format it for you!

This small library was created in order to format different money values. For example if you store the value "4100.30" with currency "USD" in you database, using cassier you can display it in a nice way to the user based on his locale:
```javascript
cassier.formatMoney(4100.30, 'USD', 'en');
```
this will output ```$ 4,100.30```, however if your user is from Germany using the ```de``` locale
```javascript
cassier.formatMoney(4100.30, 'USD', 'de');
```
will output ```US$4.100,30```

# Available on NPM
```npm install cassier```

# Available on Bower
Sorry, not yet. Will do as soon as possible.

# Build and test
You need to have grunt in order to build and test cassier.

Run ```grunt build``` to test / hint / uglify cassier, or run ```grunt test``` to run only the tests.

# Supported locales
By default en_US (named ```en``` in cassier) is supported. I also added ```de``` however I'm not fluent in German and American English is not my native language, so if the locales are incorrect, please submit pull request (en locale is define inside cassier.js).

If you want to add your locale, please submit pull request **with test** (see ```tests/locale_de.js``` for test example). Pull requests without tests won't be merged.

# How to add new locale?
1. Create a new locale file name <locale>.js when locale is either 2 letter (en, de, fr) or 4 letter (en_US, en_GB) name.
2. Use ```de.js``` as reference on how to support nodejs module or requirejs define/require.
3. You locale name should match the locale file name (i.e. en.js define locale named "en").
4. Locale settings consist of the following fields:
  1. *decimal* - this is the decimal separator character (i.e. 500.30 - dot is the separating character)
  2. *thousand* - this is the thousands separator character (i.e. 1,500,300 - comma is the separating character)
  3. *format* - the format of the number when 
    1. %s - is the minus sign position
    2. %c - is the currency sign position
    3. %v - is the value position
  4. *native_currency* - is the native currency for this locale.
